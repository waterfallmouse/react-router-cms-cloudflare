## Project Overview

This is a modern Content Management System (CMS) built with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, using React Router v7 and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. The application implements a clean architecture with TypeScript, Zod validation, and TailwindCSS for a modern, scalable content management platform. The system follows Zero Trust security principles with comprehensive RBAC implementation and Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) deployment strategies. The initial use case is a personal blog service, but the architecture is designed for extensibility to support various content types and enterprise CMS functionalities.

## Architecture & Design Patterns

### DDD Layered Architecture
- **Domain Layer**: Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services, Repository Interfaces
- **Application Layer**: Use Cases (CQRS pattern), DTOs, Application Services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Repository implementations (Prisma + Cloudflare D1/R2)
- **Presentation Layer**: React Router v7 route handlers, React components

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Router v7 with SSR support + @react-router/fs-routes
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers (edge runtime)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) with Prisma ORM
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for images
- **Authentication**: Cloudflare Access with Zero Trust security model
- **Authorization**: Comprehensive RBAC with domain-driven auth context
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS v4 (JIN-theme inspired design)
- **Validation**: Zod schemas throughout all layers
- **Testing**: Bun Test + Playwright (DORA best practices)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React Router dev tools
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
- **Logging**: Pino for high-performance structured logging
- **Monitoring**: Cloudflare Analytics Engine + external monitoring tools
- **Security**: Zero Trust implementation with device trust and network segmentation

## Development Guidelines

### DDD Implementation Rules
1. **Domain Layer**: Keep pure business logic, no external dependencies
2. **Application Layer**: Orchestrate domain objects, handle transactions
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Implement repository interfaces, external integrations
4. **Presentation Layer**: Handle HTTP requests, validation, serialization

### Code Quality Standards
- Use Zod schemas for all validation (domain and application layers)
- Write tests first (TDD approach recommended)
- Follow CQRS pattern for use cases
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage (enforced by fail_on_low_coverage)
- Use dependency injection for loose coupling
- Use Biome for consistent code formatting and linting (35x faster than Prettier)
- Follow Biome's built-in style guidelines for TypeScript/JavaScript
- Implement Zero Trust security principles in all layers
- Use structured logging with Pino for all application events
- Follow RBAC patterns for authorization throughout the application
- Implement proper error handling and audit logging for security events

### Testing Strategy (DORA Best Practices)
- **Unit Tests (70-80%)**: Domain entities, value objects, use cases
- **Integration Tests (15-25%)**: Repository implementations, API endpoints  
- **E2E Tests (5-10%)**: Critical user flows only
- Run tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Maintain fast feedback loops (<30s unit, <5min integration, <15min E2E)

### Naming Conventions
- **Entities**: PascalCase (Content, ContentType, Media)
- **Value Objects**: PascalCase (ContentTitle, ContentSlug, MediaUrl)
- **Use Cases**: PascalCase with UseCase suffix (CreateContentUseCase)
- **Repository Interfaces**: PascalCase with Interface suffix (ContentRepositoryInterface)
- **Repository Implementations**: PascalCase with technology prefix (PrismaContentRepository)

### Development Notes

- The app uses React Router v7's new architecture with @react-router/fs-routes for automatic route generation
- Cloudflare Worker bindings are available through the `AppLoadContext.cloudflare` interface
- TailwindCSS v4 is configured with the Vite plugin
- Type generation for Cloudflare bindings runs automatically after install
- The build process generates both client and server bundles for the edge runtime
- Authentication follows Zero Trust principles with multi-layer security (Cloudflare Access + Application-level RBAC)
- Authorization is implemented through comprehensive RBAC domain model with Role and Permission entities
- Media files are stored in Cloudflare R2 and metadata in D1 database
- All external inputs must be validated using Zod schemas
- Structured logging with Pino provides high-performance request tracing and audit logs
- Infrastructure is managed as code using Terraform for consistent deployments
- Security audit logging captures all authentication, authorization, and sensitive operations
- Content types are extensible and configurable with custom field schemas
- The CMS supports various content types (blog posts, pages, custom types) with role-based content management
- Domain model designed for multi-tenancy, scalability, and enterprise security requirements
- Middleware patterns handle cross-cutting concerns (auth, logging, error handling) at the route level
